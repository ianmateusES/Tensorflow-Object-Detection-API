# Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API

This is a Custom Object Detection using TensorFlow from Scratch. Here I have done a multi object classification for Kitchen Utilities. 

*You can also download the dataset from the link metioned below.*

**Link: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/UTENSILS/**

Along with this you need to download the Tensorflow Model git repo and faster rcnn model from TensorFlow's model zoo

Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models by clicking the “Clone or Download” button and downloading the zip file.

Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2 model. [Download the model here.](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz)

  The modules files that supports for this project is as shown below,
  
```
C:\> pip install protobuf
C:\> pip install pillow
C:\> pip install lxml
C:\> pip install matplotlib
C:\> pip install numpy
C:\> pip install scipy
C:\> pip install sklearn
C:\> pip install pandas
C:\> pip install opencv-python
```

**##Make sure that your always in admin mode when you work with protoc, if not you defenitely encounter error**

You may encounter an error which is **No module named 'deployment' or No module named 'nets'**
