# Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API

This is a Custom Object Detection using TensorFlow from Scratch. Here I have done a multi object classification for Kitchen Utilities. 

*You can also download the dataset from the link metioned below.*

**Link: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/UTENSILS/**

Along with this you need to download the Tensorflow Model git repo and faster rcnn model from TensorFlow's model zoo

Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models by clicking the “Clone or Download” button and downloading the zip file.

Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2 model. [Download the model here.](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz)
